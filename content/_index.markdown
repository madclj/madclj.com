## Clojure/conj Day

### 8:00 am CT → 10 min
Welcome - Rich Hickey

### 8:10 am CT → 40 min

Talk: Immutable Values in the Big Wide World
Speaker: Tim Ewald
Speaker: Paul deGrandis

The future of cloud native architectures is not serverless functions or containerized code access remote stores. It is ubiquitous quasi-infinite storage accessed by machines with a lot of memory running runtimes that can use it. In the first half of this talk, Tim will lay out the problems Kevel faced with it's legacy distributed architecture, the tensions at play in addressing the issues, and the question he asked (inspired from his time working on Datomic) that set things on their current path. In the second half, Paul will explain how we have used memory mapped databases, low latency object storage and hybrid logical clocks to build a high performance causally consistent world-wide data distribution system based on value change streams.

### 8:55 am CT → 40 min
Talk: Real-World AI Integration: An Experience Report on Enhancing Engineering Workflows
Speaker: Carin Meier
Speaker: Marlon Silva

In the pursuit of innovation, engineers often find themselves bogged down by repetitive tasks. Our goal is to reduce these toils, enabling engineers to focus more on solving hard problems and creating elegant solutions.

This presentation will share our journey from initial explorations in leveraging Generative AI as a platform, to benchmarking different LLM models, and researching optimization for Clojure code generation. We'll also discuss how AI can assist developers during the design phase by acting as a Socratic partner, enhancing their critical thinking and problem-solving processes.

Finally, we will demo some tools that we've explored that have the potential to enhance your engineering experience.

#### 9:40 am CT → 40 min
Talk: Scientific Clojure, a bird's-eye view
Speaker: Thomas Clark
Speaker: Library Intermediate Session (40 min)

Whether natural or digital, a language takes a strong community to survive. Scicloj, portmanteau pending, is both an emerging ecosystem of powerful, analytical libraries and a clojure support group for people with data. We will outline the key stacks and conventions that have matured by 2024: covering data wrangling, data science interop, maths (number-crunching, statistical and symbolic), machine learning and visualization. Having introduced some of the most powerful libraries individually, we will then show how these can be combined in a competitive and ergonomic workflow: particularly when used in conjunction with our literate programming and REPL-enhancing upgrades.

Data science with clojure might seem like an eccentric undertaking, but as we highlight the current state of SciCloj, the key people involved, documentation and reasources, the challenges and outlook for 2025 will also become clear. Whether that means a lab jacket or a straitjacket however, the community is data.

#### 12:00 pm CT → 10 min

Talk: Architecting Threat Intelligence with Clojure in Cybersecurity Detection & Response
Speaker Michael Simonson

In this session, discover how Clojure can revolutionize cybersecurity through advanced threat intelligence modeling and ingestion. Learn about our open-source repositories designed to populate an Elasticsearch document database with JSON data, imported using Clojure. Get an inside look as to how we use these tools to service a powerful Extended Detection & Response platform. Further, we'll explore how these transformers streamline threat intelligence management, making our platform both simple and powerful. We will be walking through real-world production applications, best practices, and how you can enhance your cybersecurity infrastructure and stay ahead of emerging threats.

#### 12:15 pm CT → 40 min
Title: Getting 50,000 Companies on Board with Clojure
Speaker: Cam Saul

Clojure transformed Metabase from a tiny startup to a global open-source BI powerhouse used by over 50,0000 companies every day! Here are some insider tips and lessons from a decade of real-world Clojure usage. Don’t miss out on this deep dive into success with Clojure and the invaluable lessons learned along the way.

#### 1:00 pm CT → 40 min
Title: Teaching Clojure Together
Speaker: Jordan Miller
Speaker: Rafal Dittwald

Being an expert in Clojure doesn’t make one an expert in teaching Clojure. Whether you are trying to onboard new Clojurians at work, mentoring a family member, or wrangling some “free-range learners”, understanding the basics of pedagogy can go a long way at making you a better teacher. In this talk, two of the founders of Clojure Camp will share how they’ve been applying lessons from cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization to create effective learning experiences and foster a new generation of Clojurians.


#### 2:00 pm CT → 40 min
Title: Enhancing LLM-Powered Development with Clojure's REPL
Speaker: Colin Fleming

Anyone who has tried to use a Large Language Model (LLM) for development has discovered that it's an iterative process, with many parallels to how we use our REPLs when working with Clojure. In this talk, we'll explore how to enhance this experience through a deep integration with our editor via the REPL. We'll leverage the editor to provide relevant, project-specific context to improve AI-assisted coding. Clojure's REPL serves as the perfect interface for this development style, allowing us to interactively guide and refine LLM responses before integrating them back into the project. You'll see many examples of practical techniques for augmenting the coding process with AI, while maintaining the interactive and flexible development experience we all know and love.
