# Front-end for Clojure Madison Clojure events calendar feed

Forked from https://gitlab.com/invertisment/cljcalendar/

This is a web-only preview of the calendar located [here](https://madclj.com/events.ics).
The calendar can also be shown by mobile phone calendar.

## This is for Clojure but why react

It's based on React and not ClojureScript.

Typescript was fitting the problem better than re-frame.
I needed a pre-built calendar component and other than that there is no complex state.
