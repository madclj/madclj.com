              "description": "We are excited and honored to have our dear friend James Elliott give a thrilling presentation. Join us for food and fun. Afterwards, we'll head to the Great Dane for a pint.\n\nJames Elliott is a software developer who grew up hopping between continents, and got hooked on computers as a teenager in Mexico in the ’80s, to the extent of writing his own word processor in 6502 assembly language so he could turn in high school papers with proper fonts and justification long before he could afford a Mac. He’s written a few books for O’Reilly, and is now delighted to be working in Clojure professionally, helping Singlewire build platforms for mass notification. Having settled in Madison since graduate school, he has recently rekindled a passion for electronic music by discovering the fun of mixing it for an energetic crowd as Deep Symmetry.\n\nhttp://deepsymmetry.org (http://deepsymmetry.org/)\n\nAfterglow, Live Coding for Light Shows\n\nImagine being able to turn algorithmic ideas into a dazzling lightscape engulfing you and your audience. That's Afterglow, a live-coding environment for light shows.\n\nAs a software developer who creates electronic music shows as an avocation, I wanted a way to express my wildest ideas live, in harmony with music being played. Clojure was the perfect medium for building my dream tool.\n\nAfterglow has grown from a crazy notion to a hub connecting several vibrant efforts in new, interesting ways, and has been used for performances on multiple continents. It can run alone, or hosted in Cycling '74's Max, a visual environment for experimenting with music and video. Afterglow translates abstract ideas into the low-level messages that control lighting fixtures. With the help of pieces of the Overtone project it powers intuitive physical control surfaces like Ableton Push, and offers beat synchronization with DJ equipment. I couldn't have achieved this without the expressiveness, interactivity, and compatibility of the Clojure environment, connecting everything in a coherent and extensible way. Clojure is ideal for building systems that need to walk and chew gum at the same time, and Afterglow does a lot at once.\n\nI'll explain how this open-source project came together, how a Clojure functional mindset can produce streams of dazzling effects under an operator's tactile control, will demonstrate some effects with a few lights, and will provide an introduction to the architecture and implementation of the system. The demo and explanation can go in whatever directions the audience finds most interesting.",

              "description": "ClojureScript is gaining popularity for client side web development, but which of the many ways to build a ClojureScript application should you choose?\n\nThis talk will present one combination of libraries to consider — Reagent, a ClojureScript React wrapper; DataScript, an in memory Clojure/ClojureScript DB with a Datomic like interface; and Posh, a library for linking them together.\n\nDavid Whittington will describe what each library does and present an application architecture for tying them together. He will compare this architecture to other alternatives (Om, Om.next, re-frame) and show how the ClojureScript community seems to be converging on some common patterns. Finally, he will describe some of the pros and cons of the architecture presented and suggest under what circumstance you might want to use it.\n\nDavid Whittington is an independent software developer with a background in web application development, configuration management, and healthcare information technology. He was most recently employed as a Software Architect by Sentry Data Systems. While there, he led Sentry's transition from package based server provisioning to Chef, was responsible for test automation and performance improvements to Sentry's pharmacy claims processing system, and developed an ETL pipeline for a prototype data warehousing product. Following his time at Sentry, David transitioned to working in Clojure full time and is currently developing his Clojure skills by building two applications — Memocorder (http://memocorder.com/), a notes management system, and Zetawar (http://www.zetawar.com/) , an open source turn-based tactical strategy game.",

              "description": "Presentation - Peter Schuck\n\nOne of Clojure's core ideas is the Alan Perlis quote \" It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures. \". We go even further and say that it's better to have 100 functions that operate on one abstraction.\n\nThe sequence abstraction ( https://clojure.org/reference/sequences ) is the most well known. It works not only for all Clojure data structures but Java Collections and Java Strings.\n\nThis presentation will go through these extension points, Protocols, Multi Methods, and data types. It will show how to add on new abstractions for existing data types, create new data types that implement Clojure's abstractions, how to make a new abstraction extension point, and rules of thumb of when it's best to use the tools.\n\nAfter the presentation we'll go through some exercises making our own protocols and data types.\n\nReferences - Videos\n\nProtocol XIII: Clojure Protocols Explained - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQhOlWXXl2I\n\nPurelyFunctional TV: What Problems do Clojure Protocols Solve? - https://purelyfunctional.tv/clojure-protocols/what-problems-do-clojure-protocols-solve/\n\nReferences - Online Book\n\nClojure for the Brave and True: Chapter 13 - http://www.braveclojure.com/multimethods-records-protocols/",

There is one huge hidden source of global mutable state: the database.\n\nDatomic (http://www.datomic.com/) removes that last store of global mutable state, squashing a multitude of bugs. Testing also becomes much simpler once your database is immutable.\n\nPeter Schuck will present how Datomic works, it's use and several of it's superpowers like:\n\n• Unlimited read capabilities that don't block writes\n\n• Automatic auditing capabilities to track who made what change when\n\n• Building queries out of data structures instead of string concatenation\n\n• Speculatively updating the database to see how adding data can change queries\n\n• Navigating a database entity like an object removing most of the need for an ORM.",

We'll get together to get beginners up and running with the language and the REPL, then solve some Advent of Code puzzles. The 2019 Advent of Code puzzles will be available at the link below starting December 1st, but you can try out puzzles from past years if you want to get started early.\n\nhttps://adventofcode.com/2019\nhttps://adventofcode.com/2018\nhttps://adventofcode.com/2017\n\nFor newcomers to Clojure we'll have environment setup and language introduction resources available, as well as experienced Clojure users on hand to guide you through getting started. Feel free to run through some of the resources linked below prior to the meetup if you want a head start.\n\nExperienced Clojure users can come ready to crank out solutions to a few Advent of Code puzzles. Stay until the end when folks can share their solutions and show off any interesting Clojure features employed.\n\nBendyworks are generously providing food and drink for the event.\n\n# Environment Setup:\n\nJava & Leiningen & Atom editor setup: https://gist.github.com/bgrabow/09511315debc40918fe4b7337c139c8f\n\n# Learn Clojure:\n\nIf you're short on time: Learn Clojure in Y Minutes\nhttps://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/\n\nA more comprehensive intro: Clojure for the Brave and True\nhttp://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/",

              "description": "We have three talks this month!\n\nAgenda:\n\\- 6:30pm arrive and eat \\(pizza\\)\n\\- 7:00pm talks \\(3 x 15\\+5m\\)\n\\- 8:00pm official business ends\\, stay for informal discussion and food\n\n[Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIfynMppxcw)\n\n**Talk 1: [Eric Normand](ericnormand.me)**\n\n**Virtual Threads in Clojure**\nJDK 21 provides virtual threads which allow for much more concurrency than OS threads. In this talk, we'll see how to use them from Clojure, how they differ from OS threads, and what might change in the future.\n\n**Bio**\nEric Normand is a Clojure and functional programming teacher. He has been programming in Clojure since 2008 and teaching it since 2013. You can find him online at [ericnormand.me](http://ericnormand.me/).\n\n**Talk 2: [Sayan Sivakumaran](https://sayansivakumaran.com/)**\n\n**How does CSS affect the Accessibility Tree?**\nIt's a common misconception that HTML is the only thing that affects how assistive technologies (like screen readers) interact with the web, even though that isn't true. For example, did you know that [the CSS border styling of table cells](https://sayansivakumaran.com/posts/2023/6/browser-table-accessibility-remediation/#determining-table-ness-via-the-css-border-of-table-cells) affects whether small HTML tables are exposed as a table in the accessibility tree or not? Other types of CSS can change how the accessibility tree is exposed as well - there has been an attempt to standardize this behavior with [the CSS-AAM](https://w3c.github.io/css-aam/), although there doesn't seem to have been a lot of work in this area recently.\n\nLet's explore some of the weird, implementation-defined ways that CSS can affect the accessibility tree!\n\n**Bio**\n[Sayan Sivakumaran](https://sayansivakumaran.com/) is a developer at Singlewire that has done open source work on both Chromium accessibility and the ARIA specification suite (more specifically, the Core-AAM). While they are taking a temporary break from open source accessibility work to explore systems programming, making the web more accessible is still something that they hold close to their heart!\n\n**Talk 3: David Whittington**\n\n**Exploring Clojure as a Theory of Constraints modeling environment**\nThe \"Theory of Constraints\" (TOC) is a management philosophy introduced by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his 1984 book titled \"The Goal\". It is designed to help organizations continually achieve their goals by identifying and managing constraints that hinder performance. The central premise of TOC is that every system, regardless of how well it performs, has at least one constraint that limits its ability to achieve more of its goals.\n\nVarious software software tools exist to support the TOC modeling process, but they're generally not hacker friendly. Can we do better in Clojure? Let's tinker and find out.\n\n**Bio**\nDavid Whittington is a system architect at PDS, Inc. where he is helping build [ar.io](http://ar.io/), an access protocol for the Arweave perpetual data storage network. Previously he has worked on streaming metrics indexing and simulation testing for satellite systems, a ClojureScript strategy game (Zetawar), pharmacy claims processing systems, and early IaaC systems. He enjoys free software, permissionless systems, functional programming, optimizing databases, and immutability.",

At that meetup James mentioned he’d started to reverse-engineer the protocol used by Pioneer DJ pro gear so he could sync light shows to it. That spawned its own set of projects which have blown up, and he’s been contacted by several artists who feature prominently in his own music collection for help using the software in their tours and streams, and even tricked Deadmau5 into learning a little Clojure.\n\nThis presentation will explore how DJ performances work today, give highlights of the degree to which we can now tap into the hardware over the network, and demonstrate some of the cool tricks this enables. Clojure has been the glue that allowed James to accidentally create an integration environment for performances, in response to interesting ideas from club resident techs, touring performers, and their front-of-house tech crews.",

He’s written a few books for O’Reilly, and is now delighted to be working in Clojure professionally, helping Singlewire build platforms for mass notification.

Do you ever wish the web was made out of persistent data structures? There are real projects underway to make this happen.\nCome to this talk to learn about the various efforts to construct large-scale decentralized storage systems, so we can finally have an immutable web of values. We'll cover things like IPFS, IPLD, Arweave, Filecoin, and other related technologies.\nWarning: this talk will mention blockchains! If this is off-putting, do not fear! There will be plenty of non-blockchain content, and blockchains will be discussed purely as an implementation strategy to solve particular technical problems.\n\n**Bio**\nDavid Whittington is a system architect at PDS, Inc. where he is helping build [ar.io](http://ar.io/), an access protocol for the Arweave perpetual data storage network.

For example, to specify a map with one key or another but not both, the dreaded addition of :and + :fn is needed to assert a postcondition on the map. This then negatively affects error messages and generating examples.\n\nWe then propose a clean solution to this problem, and many problems like it, by adding support for constraints on individual schemas.",

My renewal payment of $180 for the next six months is coming due December 6th, and I don’t plan to give them the updated credit card information they need even if I am unable to navigate their dark patterns of canceling it by contacting their billing department. Can we find a less overpriced way to organize and keep in touch with people?",
